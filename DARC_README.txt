This is the current working version of the Developled Atomic Rydberg Calcualtor.

All the python files containing the functionality are stored in the /arc folder.  

If you are just making some ammendments to the functionaltity (And don't care
about the docs or the acutal packaging of the code) then you only need to 
look in this folder. 

If you are releasing a new version then the docs can be found in /docs
setup.py - contains all the metadata for the package, and what is required
for publishing on the Python Package Index (PyPI)
